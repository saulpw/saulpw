### Welcome to Saulville

I live in the terminal, at the intersection of data and fun:

- I created [VisiData](https://visidata.org), a magical little utility for slicing and dicing data.
- The [devottys](https://github.com/devottys/) (of which I am a founding member) are a small group of terminal fans who are constantly on the lookout for collaborators on [small art projects and games](https://bluebird.sh).
- You can sponsor my work on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/saulpw) or via [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/saulpw).
- Fun fact: In 2016, I [uncovered a crossword scandal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aHfK8EUIzg) while cleaning [the largest collection of crossword puzzles on the planet](https://xd.saul.pw) into my [own text crossword format](https://github.com/century-arcade/xd).

If you find this kind of stuff interesting, please reach out.  Email me at `code@saul.pw`, or come chat with us on IRC (`libera.chat/#visidata`) or on [Discord](https://saul.pw/chat).  I'd love to talk with you!
