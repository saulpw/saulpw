### Hola amigos

I like to do fun stuff with data and the terminal.  I dual-classed librarian/mage and this is how it's turning out:

- I created [VisiData](https://visidata.org), a magical little utility for slicing and dicing data.
- I'm currently working on [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org), which makes it easy to create data analysis queries for large databases in Python.
- The [devottys](https://github.com/devottys/) (of which I am a founding member) are a small group of terminal devotees who are constantly on the lookout for collaborators on small art projects and games.
- You can sponsor my work on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/saulpw) or via [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/saulpw).
- Fun fact: I [uncovered a crossword scandal](https://saul.pw/videos/xd) while cleaning [the largest collection of crossword puzzles on the planet](https://xd.saul.pw) (2016)

If you find this kind of stuff interesting, please reach out.  Email me at `code@saul.pw`, or come chat with us on IRC (`libera.chat/#visidata`) or on [Discord](https://saul.pw/chat).  I'd love to talk with you!
